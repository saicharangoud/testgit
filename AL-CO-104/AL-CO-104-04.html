                                This document is to be completed prior to admission by the individual and/or
                                their family. This document provides a way to gather preliminary information
                                and have discussion with the individual and/or their family.
                                This document is intended to be used before other Assessments
                                are completed. It is important to obtain as much information directly
                                from the individual as possible. It is possible that you or another staff
                                member will complete this document during an interview with the potential resident.

                                family to complete this form or answer these questions.
                                This is a starting point for you, as the potential residential
                                provider, to begin to understand the individual and their needs.

                                Review this information and begin to form questions and note any areas of concern,
                                so as to understand if this person may or may not be a good fit in your Assisted Living Residence.

                                if the individual reports using injectables (shots) for medications, you will
                                need to determine if the individual is fully capable of independent self-administration
                                (via discussion or demonstration), if you will have appropriate medical staff to administer
                                the medication (nurse), or if the individual will receive Home Health services to administer
                                the injectable medication.
